### Privacy and Security Notice

This software is designed to process files entirely within the user's browser. 
No files, file contents, or hash results are transmitted to any external servers

### Disclaimer

While this software uses industry-standard cryptographic algorithms, users should:

1. **Verify hash results** using multiple tools for critical security applications
2. **Keep software updated** to ensure latest security patches
3. **Understand limitations** of browser-based cryptographic implementations
4. **Use appropriate algorithms** for their specific security requirements

The authors and contributors make no warranties about the cryptographic strength 
or security properties of the generated hashes beyond what is provided by the 
underlying browser implementations and cryptographic libraries.
